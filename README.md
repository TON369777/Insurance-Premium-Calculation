# Insurance-Premium-Calculation

Data set obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simranjain17/insurance

Insurance companies rely on actuarial methods to calculate premiums on their insurance policy offerings to customers. However, Machine Learning methods can be used to engineer a method to calculate premiums based on a given data set.

#### NOTE
Examining this dataset from Kaggle, one bit of data that is missing is the amount of cover that each customer has as well as what type of insurance policy each customer holds e.g. Life, TPD and/or Income Protection.

### Machine Learning Model Chosen: Multiple Linear Regression

Other Models can be used to see if it would further optimise results. Workings show that this model is only ~74% accurate on test data.
